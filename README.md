## Description
The app is for tracking habits using Tkinter. I used OOP in creating habits, so habits here are classes. There two types of habits, daily habit named Habit, and weekly habit. 
the user can create habits by simply entering a habit's name. The project has many input fields, for creating habits, viewing completed dates for each habit, checking longest streaks and checking when 
the user has broken a habit. 

The way you check when you completed a habit, longest streak or when you broke it, is by typing its name. You'll know the habits because they're printed in the terminal as soon as you run the program. 

## Tech & libraries 
The libraries are sqlite3, Tkinter and datetime module. When a user creates a habit, the input string is used to create an object with it, the string is also saved into the DB.
